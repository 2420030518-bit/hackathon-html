Rotten Onions is a sleek and modern web application for discovering movies and TV series. Inspired by popular rating sites, it provides users with a rich interface to explore popular, top-rated, and trending content. Users can view details, watch trailers, see where to stream, and keep track of their viewing history and liked movies.

This project is built as a single-page application using vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating how to create a dynamic and feature-rich user experience by interacting with external APIs.
